## Acknowledgements

Use of a variation on cory house's (https://github.com/coryhouse) react slingshot was used in the setting up of this project. We used his pluralsight redux starter repo as an example for our project so we could follow his tutorial on pluralsight as well. The setup of the project may change in the future to use tools like redux sagas but this was our starting off point.
